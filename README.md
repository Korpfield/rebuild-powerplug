# RE:BUILD

## Remote Controlled Powerplug

Develop environment to use remote controlled powerplugs with C.H.I.P. Find a way to use them with C.H.I.P and build some practical applications which 
C.H.I.P can then control. 

After the environment is setup you can develop API for using the application over network. Then you can easily integrate the system to any software.
If you have time you can build controller application using the API, such as Android application.

Focus on:
- Good documentation for setting up similar environment and for using the API
- Choosing well suiting technologies and keeping the system secure
- Implementing practical and clever applications to use with the powerplugs. Think out of the box!
