# RE:BUILD

## Remote Controlled Powerplug

Develop environment to use remote controlled powerplugs with C.H.I.P. Find a way to use them with C.H.I.P and build some practical applications which 
C.H.I.P can then control. 

As you build the environment you can setup an API for using the applications through C.H.I.P. There is another project that works with controller software
that uses your API. Make a good documentation for the API and work closely with this another group.

Focus on:
- Good documentation for users setting up similar environment and for using the API
- Choosing well suiting technologies and keeping the system secure
- Implementing practical and clever applications to use with the powerplugs. Think out of the box!
